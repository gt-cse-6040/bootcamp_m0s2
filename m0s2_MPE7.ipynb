    "Letter frequency in text has been studied in cryptoanalysis, in particular frequency analysis. Linguists use letter frequency analysis as a rudimentary technique for language identification, where it's particularly effective as an indicator of whether an unknown writing system is alphabetic, syllablic, or ideographic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primarily, three different ways exist for letter frequency analysis. Each way generally results in very different charts for common letters. Based on the provided text, the first method is to count letter frequency in root words of a dictionary. The second way is to include all word variants when counting, such as gone, going and goes and not just the root word go. Such a system results in letters like \"s\" appearing much more frequently. The last variant is to count letters based on their frequency in the actual text that is being studied. \n",
